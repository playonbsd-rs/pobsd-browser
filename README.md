- [x] Use output of steamctl to indicate owned games in the list (no clue about how to do the same for Gog)
- [x] Filters on owned games
- [ ] Provide instructions to install Steam games (no clue about how to do for Gog)
- [ ] Choose a license
- [ ] Integrate data from IGDB (probably using pobsd.chocolatines.org)
- [ ] Maybe provide a way to launch some games from the TUI (e.g., using IndieRunner)
