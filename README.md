### playonbsd-browser

Terminal user interface to browse the PlayOnBSD database.


#### Roadmap

- [x] Properly display game list
- [x] Properly display game details
- [x] Use output of steamctl to indicate owned games in the list (no clue about how to do the same for Gog)
- [x] Filters on owned games
- [x] Write a man page
- [ ] Use pledge/unveil
- [ ] Provide instructions to install Steam games (no clue about how to do for Gog)
- [ ] Choose a license
- [ ] Integrate data from IGDB (probably using pobsd.chocolatines.org)
- [ ] Maybe provide a way to launch some games from the TUI (e.g., using IndieRunner)


#### Documentation
There is [website](https://playonbsd-rs.github.io/pobsd-browser.1.html) now. No more need for
a man page (who read them anyways?)
